## A script for downloading the OTB dataset

The original source for the OTB dataset is no longer available: [cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark.](http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark)
This script therefore downloads the OTB-50 and OTB-100 datasets for archived copies thanks to [Archive's Wayback Machine.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230321033248/http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/)
The result will be two directories: ./OTB50 and ./OTB100, each containing a series of sequences in .zip format.
If you want to automatically unzip all of the sequences, uncomment the last two lines of the script.
